2. 'Within India'.—If the offence is committed outside India it is not punishable under
the Penal Code, unless it has been made so by means of special provisions such as
sections 3, 4, 108A, etc., of the Code. Under section179 of the Cr PC, 1973 even the
place(s) wherein the consequence (of the criminal act) "ensues" would be relevant to
determine the Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, even the Courts within whose
local jurisdiction, the repercussion/effect of the criminal act occurs, would have
jurisdiction in the matter. When the consequence of an act committed by a foreigner
outside India if ensued in India, he can be tried in India.27. Normally crime carries the
person. The commission of a crime gives the Court of the place where it is committed
jurisdiction over the person of the offender.28.
